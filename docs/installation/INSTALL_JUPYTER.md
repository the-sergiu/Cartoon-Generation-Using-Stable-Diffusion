title: Running InvokeAI on Google Colab using a Jupyter Notebook
---

# THIS NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT

## Introduction

We have a [Jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/blob/main/notebooks/Stable-Diffusion-local-Windows.ipynb)
with cell-by-cell installation steps. It will download the code in
this repo as one of the steps, so instead of cloning this repo, simply
download the notebook from the link above and load it up in VSCode
(with the appropriate extensions installed)/Jupyter/JupyterLab and
start running the cells one-by-one.

!!! Note "you will need NVIDIA drivers, Python 3.10, and Git installed beforehand"
